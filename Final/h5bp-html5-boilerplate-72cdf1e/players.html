				<h3>Team of the Week</h3>
				<ul class= "gallery">
				
					<h4>Giovanni Bush</h4><li><img alt="player" src="img/dio.jpg"></li>
					<div class="section-in"><p>A goal poacher, with a venomous strike. Giovanni has all the qualities you want in a forward plus some.</p>
						<br>_____________________________________________________________________________________</br>
						</div>
						
					<br></br>
			
					<h4>Alex Cowan</h4><li><img alt="player" src="img/siralex.jpg"></li>
					
					<div class="section-in"><p>Alex is a dangerous center-attacking midfielder, with the vision of a hawk. His versatility in picking out perfect passes and having the goal scoring instinct of a striker makes him a must have on any team.</p>
						<br>_____________________________________________________________________________________</br>
						</div>
					<br></br>
					
					<h4>Trent Cristie</h4>
					<li><img alt="player" src="img/trent.jpg"></li>
					
					<div class="section-in"><p>Trent is a highly experienced football player and has very intricate knowledge of the game. He is able to play nearly any position and is equally good at all of them. His most famous trait is that of his curling free kicks which has the ability to catch any keeper off-guard</p>
						<br>_____________________________________________________________________________________</br>
						</div>		
					<br></br>
					
					<h4>Thomas Cowan</h4>
					<li><img alt="player" src="img/tommy.jpg"></li>
					
					<div class="section-in"><p>Like a brick wall in the defense, Tommy is nearly impossible to pass one-on-one. His precision tackles and natural aggression makes him one of the most well rounded defenders in the league. Just because he's a defender however, doesn't mean he can't provide a shot on target every now and then</p>
						<br>_____________________________________________________________________________________</br>
						</div>
					<br></br>
					
					<h4>Matthew Day</h4>
					<li><img alt="player" src="img/matt.jpg"></li>
					
					<div class="section-in"><p>Another top-class striker, Matt Day provides not only strength to hold off defenders, but also height. Standing at 6'4", he's a target man for any winger to cross the ball into. Both a strong header and striker of the ball, what more can you ask for in a forward? </p>
						<br>_____________________________________________________________________________________</br>
						</div>
						
					<br></br>
					
					<h4>Ben Drummond</h4>
					<li><img alt="player" src="img/ben.jpg"></li>
					
					<div class="section-in"><p>Ben is a tall, lanky individual, who at first would not strike you as a football player. Don't be fooled by appearances however, as this guy is one of the best wingers in the game. He has exceptional speed, skill, and touch, which makes him a nightmare for anyone defending him. That complimented with his precision crosses and powerful strike, Ben is no force to be reckoned with.</p>
