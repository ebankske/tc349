<h1>My Personal Website Information</h1>
<h2>What I hope to Accomplish for my Final Project</h2>
<p>For my final project, I intend on creating a personal website for a recreational football (soccer) league I am apart of. The league is called “Sunday Footy” and welcomes anyone who enjoys the football to come out and play. The league contains primarily men, but some women to participate in some of the games. The ages range from 14-25 therefore this will be the audience viewing my sight. </p>
<p>As I am targeting a teen-young adult audience, predominantly males, I am looking to create a simple, easy to navigate website, whilst still being eye-catching and informative. I want people who visit the website to captured by the styles, fonts, etc. in order to better persuade them to come out and join the league.  I think this combination will work perfect with what I am looking to accomplish as the end result.</p>

	<h3>Interpreting Results</h3>
	<p>After an analysis of all 3 participants and myself, it can be seen that the categories are all related and pretty much the same. I personally liked the sorting of Participant 1's categories. As I am looking to create a simple and easy to navigate webpage, his ability to put all the links under 3 main categories was very appealing to me</p>
		<p>I found it very useful to see the results of each of my participants in comparison to mine. It has helped me think of categorical names and what items I can include in each. This will help me optimize my sight in order to create an ideal webpage for the users</p>
